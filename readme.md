# 🌍 Link Between Population Growth and Resource Use

### 📘 Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between **population growth** and **resource consumption** using real-world data from the **United Nations** and other open sources.
It examines how rising population levels increase the demand for **energy**, **food**, and **water**, and visualizes the correlation between population trends and resource use across years.

---

## 🧠 Description

Population growth directly affects the consumption of natural and energy resources.
As the number of people increases, the need for electricity, transportation, food, and clean water also grows. This increased demand puts pressure on limited natural resources and contributes to issues such as deforestation, climate change, and pollution.

By analyzing global data, this project demonstrates how **population rise** influences **energy use and resource demand**, helping policymakers and researchers understand the importance of **sustainable development**.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Study global population growth patterns using UN data.
* Analyze the correlation between population increase and resource consumption.
* Visualize relationships between population, energy use, and time.
* Predict future energy demand based on population projections.

## 🧾 Dataset Information

**1. UN Population Data:**
📊 Source: [UN World Population Prospects](https://population.un.org/wpp/)
Contains annual population estimates and projections by country.

**2. Energy Consumption Data:**
📊 Source: [World Bank Data – Energy Use (kg of oil equivalent per capita)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.USE.PCAP.KG.OE)

Both datasets can be merged using **Country** and **Year** columns.

## 💻 How to Run

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
2. Download and place datasets in the project folder.
3. Run the Python script or Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   python population_resource_analysis.py
   ```
4. View graphs and results showing the population-resource relationship.

## 📊 Sample Output

* Scatter plot showing correlation between **population** and **energy consumption**.
* Line chart showing **population and energy trend over years** for a selected country.
* Regression-based prediction for future resource demand.

---

## 🧩 Results and Conclusion

The analysis shows a **positive correlation** between population growth and energy/resource use.
As the population increases, the demand for energy and natural resources also rises.
This highlights the need for **sustainable energy management** and **efficient resource planning** to meet future global needs.
